# Notes for project demo


Good morning


Project = TrackerDash

It is a data drivin analytics dashboard server developed for the dev teams
at Cisco in reading.

Its primary aim is to not only give product health snapshots of a given
product in real time
but integrate multiple test and reporting servers into a visual display.

The project in itself consisted of three deliverables.
*   The Analytics Server and a suit of API's to post and retrieve data
    and configuration information

*   A python library to be easily integrated in tests that drive this
    API suit which will be used to drive the data throughout this demo.

*   And a set of documentation for all the previous delivarables mentioned,
    some of which is on the screen now.

This server was designed to be opensource and easily picked up by other developers
for them to pick up and use and add their own features to in the future.
